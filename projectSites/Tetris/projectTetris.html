			<p>	<u>About the project:</u><br>
				This project was my final assignment in computer science at my graduating class at school and had its main emphasis on Microsoft Access (Visual Basic). 
				We were allowed to choose a project by ourselves under the condition that our teacher approved of our choice. 
				Since Visual Basic and Microsoft Access specifically is not a "videogame-friendly environment", 
				I was told that my project would not be realistic to succeed at my level of experience and expertise. 
				<br><br>
				<u>Features:</u><br>
				<b>-|</b> The I- (once as I and once rotated) and O-Block of Tetris (since Access does not know any shapes with 4+ corners/vertices
				adding blocks like the T or the Z would have taken longer and I would have missed the deadline)<br>
				<b>-|</b> Ex-/Importable highscore table with usernames<br>
				<b>-|</b> Developer mode with the ability to pause the game, spawn certain blocks and to see console output of usefull information<br>
				<b>-|</b> Increasing difficulty over time with a logical point system and combos
				<br><br>
				<u>About the code:</u><br>
				Everything in this project is developed by myself and programmed solely within Microsoft Access in Visual Basic. 
				I am aware that there are bugs and problems that could easily be fixed, 
				but I do not want to alter the code for sentimental reasons as it would no longer be my first real game I ever really created by myself.<br>
				I would love to talk about the code, but I will keep this short as you can download the entire game files below 
				(notes are in German since this was a school project).<br>
				The main core of the game is the 2D string array which saves every information about which field is occupied by which block. 
				This array works similar to a coordinate system and is checked for every move of any block. 
				Each block (when moved) disposes of a pivot position and information about its width and height. 
				By the use of this information, every next surrounding position can easily be calculated and checked before moving.<br>
				Whenever a block is set to be solid, a small algorithm checks which rows have been affected by the block in order to check those rows if they are occupied. 
				If the relevant rows are occupied, every block that is inside of that row will shrink and move downwards and 
				every block above that row will also move downwards. The program will then check, 
				if any other block can be moved even further downwards before spawning the next block at the top of the screen.
